- 👋 Hi, I’m @1i Patrick O'Sullivan from Dublin Ireland
- 🔧 I'm an engineer — that means I solve problems. Not problems like 'What is beauty?' because that would fall within the purview of your conundrums of philosophy.
- 👀 I’m interested in tech, nature and gaming
- 🧑‍💼 I currently work on mostly Java stuff that work throws at me.
