- 👋 Hi, I’m @1i Patrick O'Sullivan, I WFH in Dublin Ireland.
- 🔧 I'm an engineer — that means I solve problems. Not problems like 'What is beauty?' because that would fall within the purview of your conundrums of philosophy.
- 👀 I’m interested in tech, nature and gaming. See [ebirdus](https://github.com/1i/ebirdus) and https://ebird.org/home
- 🧑‍💼 I currently work on mostly Java stuff that corpo work throws at me.
